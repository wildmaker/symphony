# Symphony

Fork of [openai/symphony](https://github.com/openai/symphony) with better defaults for production use and a complete onboarding flow. Push tickets to a Linear board, agents ship the code.

## Quick start

If you have an AI coding agent, one command:

```
npx skills add odysseus0/symphony -s symphony-setup -y
```

Then ask your agent to set up Symphony for your repo.

## How it works

Symphony polls a Linear project for active tickets. Each ticket gets an isolated workspace clone and a Codex agent. The agent reads the ticket, writes a plan, implements, validates, and opens a PR. You review PRs and move tickets through states — the agents handle the rest.

The state machine lives in `WORKFLOW.md` — a markdown file with YAML frontmatter for config and a prompt body that defines agent behavior. Hot-reloads in under a second, no restart needed.

## What's different from upstream

- **Token-efficient Linear operations** — pre-built GraphQL patterns for all common operations (workpad sync, state transitions, PR attachment, issue creation) with minimal return fields, so agents never burn tokens on schema introspection
- **Correct sandbox** — the workflow is git + GitHub PR centric. Upstream's default sandbox blocks `.git/` writes, which silently breaks the entire flow. Fixed.
- **Media uploads via Linear** — upstream references a GitHub media upload skill that doesn't ship. The workflow and Linear skill now use Linear's native `fileUpload` mutation for screenshots and recordings
- **Setup skill** — auto-detects your repo, installs worker skills, creates Linear workflow states, and verifies everything before launch

## Manual setup

1. Build: `git clone https://github.com/odysseus0/symphony && cd symphony/elixir && mise trust && mise install && mise exec -- mix setup && mise exec -- mix build`
2. Install skills: `npx skills add odysseus0/symphony -a codex -s linear land commit push pull debug --copy -y` and copy `elixir/WORKFLOW.md` to your repo
3. In WORKFLOW.md, set `tracker.project_slug` and `hooks.after_create` (clone your repo + setup commands)
4. Add **Rework**, **Human Review**, **Merging** as custom states in Linear (Team Settings → Workflow)
5. Commit, push, then: `mise exec -- ./bin/symphony /path/to/your-repo/WORKFLOW.md`
